\title{Read feature table exported from FBMN/Hitchhiker's Guide workflow}
\usage{
read_ft(path, sort_by_names = FALSE, p_sep = ",")
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{Character. Path to the exported feature table (CSV or delimited).}

\item{sort_by_names}{Logical. If TRUE, row names (usually sample names or
feature IDs) are sorted alphabetically (default = FALSE).}

\item{p_sep}{Character. Field separator used in the file. Default is \code{","}.}
}
\value{
A transposed numeric data.frame where:
\itemize{
\item rows correspond to samples
\item columns correspond to features
Feature IDs have \code{.mzML} removed.
}
}
\description{
Imports a feature table generated following the workflow described in
Pakkir Shah et al. (Nature Protocols) for feature-based molecular networking.
The function reads the table, optionally sorts rows by feature names, removes
trailing \code{.mzML} from row names, and returns the \strong{transposed} table so that
features become columns and samples become rows.
}
\details{
The function expects an export format compatible with the Hitchhiker's Guide /
FBMN workflow (GNPS), typically including:
\itemize{
\item a header row
\item first column containing feature identifiers
\item sample intensities across columns
}

The returned object is transposed because many downstream analyses in this
project expect \strong{samples as rows} and \strong{features as columns}.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Read feature table as exported by the FBMN workflow
ft <- read_ft("feature_table.csv")

# Read and sort by row names
ft_sorted <- read_ft("feature_table.csv", sort_by_names = TRUE)
}
}

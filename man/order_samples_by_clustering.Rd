\title{Order Samples According to Hierarchical Clustering}
\usage{
order_samples_by_clustering(feature_table)
}
\arguments{
\item{feature_table}{A numeric data frame or matrix where rows represent
features (e.g., taxa, genes, metabolites) and columns represent samples.
Row names are treated as feature identifiers.}
}
\value{
A character vector of sample names ordered according to the
hierarchical clustering.
}
\description{
Computes a hierarchical clustering of samples based on their feature
profiles and returns the sample names in the order determined by the
clustering dendrogram. This is useful for ordering heatmaps, barplots,
or other visualizations consistently with sample similarity.
}
\details{
The function:
\itemize{
\item Converts row names into a column and transposes the data so that
samples become rows for clustering.
\item Computes Euclidean distances between samples.
\item Performs hierarchical clustering using Ward's \code{D2} method.
\item Extracts sample names in the order they appear in the dendrogram.
}

The resulting sample order is often used for heatmap column ordering or to
ensure consistent clustering-based visualization across analyses.

\examples{
\dontrun{
sample_order <- order_samples_by_clustering(feature_table)
heatmap(feature_table[, sample_order])

\alias{remove_feature_by_prefix}
\title{Remove features whose names begin with specified prefixes}
\usage{
remove_feature_by_prefix(df, patterns)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A matrix or data.frame with features in rows.}

\item{patterns}{Character vector of prefixes that should trigger removal.
Each element is interpreted as a \emph{literal prefix} used to identify
unwanted features.}
}
\value{
The input \code{df} with all rows removed whose row names begin with
any of the specified prefixes.
}
\description{
Filters a feature table by removing any rows (features) whose row names
start with one or more given prefixes. Matching is performed using a
combined regular expression and is case-sensitive unless patterns
include case-insensitive constructs.
}
\details{
The function builds a single regex of the form:
\code{"^(prefix1|prefix2|...)"}
and removes all rows whose row names match this expression.

If no rows match any prefix, the original table is returned unchanged.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Remove all features beginning with "Blank" or "Control"
ft_clean <- remove_feature_by_prefix(
  df = feature_table,
  patterns = c("Blank", "Control")
)
}
}

\title{Cluster Samples and Compute Mean Abundance of a Given Species}
\usage{
cluster_mean_abundance(
  df,
  species_name,
  k = 2,
  method = "euclidean",
  show_samples = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A numeric data frame or matrix where rows represent taxa (e.g.,
species or strains) and columns represent samples.}

\item{species_name}{Character string giving the row name of the species whose
mean abundance should be computed within each cluster.}

\item{k}{Integer. Number of clusters to cut the hierarchical clustering tree
into. Default is \code{2}.}

\item{method}{Character string specifying the distance metric passed to
\code{\link{dist}}. Default is \code{"euclidean"}.}

\item{show_samples}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, prints the sample names belonging
to each cluster. Default is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
This function is called for its side effects (printed output) and does
not return a value.
}
\description{
Performs hierarchical clustering of samples based on their abundance profiles
and computes the mean relative abundance of a specified species within each
cluster. Optionally prints the sample names assigned to each cluster.
}
\details{
The function:
\itemize{
\item Computes a distance matrix between samples (\code{dist(t(df))}).
\item Performs hierarchical clustering with \code{\link{hclust}}.
\item Cuts the tree into \code{k} clusters using \code{\link{cutree}}.
\item Computes the mean abundance of the target species within each cluster.
}

Results (cluster means and optionally sample lists) are printed to the console.

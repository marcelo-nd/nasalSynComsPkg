\title{Filter features by minimum count across samples}
\usage{
filter_features_by_col_counts(feature_table, min_count, col_number)
}
\arguments{
\item{feature_table}{A numeric matrix or data.frame with features in rows
and samples in columns.}

\item{min_count}{Numeric scalar. Minimum count value for a column to be
considered "present".}

\item{col_number}{Integer scalar. Minimum number of columns that must meet
\code{min_count} for a feature to be kept.}
}
\value{
A subset of \code{feature_table} containing only rows that meet the
filtering criteria. If no features pass the filter, an object with zero
rows (but same columns) is returned.
}
\description{
Filters rows (features) of a count table, keeping only those that have
at least \code{min_count} in at least \code{col_number} columns.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Keep features present (>= 10 counts) in at least 3 samples
filtered <- filter_features_by_col_counts(ft, min_count = 10, col_number = 3)
}
}

\title{Set selected species-sample combinations to zero}
\usage{
zero_out_species_in_samples(df, species_name, sample_names)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A numeric matrix or data.frame where rows are species
and columns are samples.}

\item{species_name}{Character. Single species name (must match a row name).}

\item{sample_names}{Character vector of sample names (must match column names).}
}
\value{
The same object as \code{df}, with the selected species in the selected
samples set to zero.
}
\description{
Sets specified entries of a species-by-sample abundance matrix to zero.
This is useful for removing detected species from selected samples
(e.g., manual curation or experimental design adjustments).
}
\details{
The function performs two safety checks:
\itemize{
\item Species must exist in \code{rownames(df)}.
\item All provided sample names must exist in \code{colnames(df)}.
}

If any name is missing, the function stops with an informative error.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Remove species "Staphylococcus aureus" from samples SC7_1 and SC7_2
cleaned_df <- zero_out_species_in_samples(
  df = abundance_table,
  species_name = "Staphylococcus aureus",
  sample_names = c("SC7_1", "SC7_2")
)
}
}

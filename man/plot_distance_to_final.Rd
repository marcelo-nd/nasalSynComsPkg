\title{Plot distance-to-final-state trajectories per SynCom}
\usage{
plot_distance_to_final(per_sample, summary_tbl)
}
\arguments{
\item{per_sample}{Tibble produced by \code{compute_distance_to_final()$per_sample}.
Must include \code{syncom_id}, \code{time_num}, and \code{dist_to_TF}.}

\item{summary_tbl}{Tibble produced by \code{compute_distance_to_final()$summary}.
Must include \code{syncom_id}, \code{time_num}, and \code{mean_dist_to_TF}.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot} object.
}
\description{
Creates a faceted plot (one panel per SynCom) showing per-sample Bray-Curtis
distance to the SynCom-specific final state (TF) over time. Individual samples
are shown as jittered points, and the mean distance at each time point is
overlaid as a line and points.

\dontrun{
out <- compute_distance_to_final(meta, X, mode = "allpair_mean")
p <- plot_distance_to_final(out$per_sample, out$summary)
